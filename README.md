# Pong with godot
This is a tiny demo project that implements the classic video game *pong*, with the amazing open-source engine [godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

The scripting language used in this project is GDScript. For more information, visit the [godot engine docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/).

### Building the project
Use the godot engine editor to export the game, or run directly from the godot engine editor.

### Files
The files that end with .gd are simply text files and contain scripts for the corresponding game object (.tscn files). I know the file structures are messy but i can't be bothered to modify it at this point.

### Releases
Proceed to the Release section to download the binaries (and for more info).

### LICENSE
This project is released under the MIT License.
